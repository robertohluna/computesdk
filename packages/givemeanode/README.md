# @computesdk/givemeanode

[givemeanode](https://givemeanode.com) provider for ComputeSDK. Very fast
microVM sandboxes.

## Installation & Setup

```bash
npm install @computesdk/givemeanode
```

Mint a token and put it in a `.env` file. Any org admin can mint one from
[/team](https://givemeanode.com/team) or the CLI; it is shown once.

```bash
gman token create --name computesdk --workspace my-workspace
# prints GMN_TOKEN=gmnt_... once
```

```bash
GMN_TOKEN=gmnt_your_token
# Optional. Defaults to us-west-2. givemeanode runs an endpoint per region
# and they are not interchangeable for latency, so set this to the one
# nearest your workload.
GMN_API_HOST=https://api.use1.givemeanode.com
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { givemeanode } from '@computesdk/givemeanode'

const compute = givemeanode({ apiKey: process.env.GMN_TOKEN })

const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create()
const result = await sandbox.runCommand('node -v')
console.log(result.stdout) // v24.19.0
await sandbox.destroy()
```

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiKey` | `string` | `GMN_TOKEN` | The `gmnt_` org service token. |
| `baseUrl` | `string` | `GMN_API_HOST`, else `https://api.givemeanode.com` | Which regional endpoint to use. |
| `fastToken` | `'absorb' \| 'prime' \| 'off'` | `'absorb'` | See below. |
| `transport` | `'auto' \| 'http2' \| 'fetch'` | `'auto'` | One HTTP/2 session for every request, or `fetch`. See "One connection for a burst". |
| `warm` | `'connect' \| 'prime' \| 'off'` | `'connect'` | What construction does with the connection. See "One connection for a burst". |
| `connectTimeout` | `number` | `10000` | How long opening the HTTP/2 session may take, in ms. |
| `ramGib` | `number` | 2 | Guest memory. `memoryMiB` / `memMiB` on `create` are read too and rounded up to whole GiB; `memory` is decimal MB, per the shared options. |
| `egress` | `'open' \| 'none'` | account default | Whether the guest can reach the network. Fixed when the guest image is prepared, not per command. |
| `execRetries` | `number` | 1 | See "Two behaviours worth knowing about". |
| `timeout` | `number` | 120000 | Per-request timeout in ms. |

## Asking for more than one core

A sandbox is one vCPU by default. `create` takes a vCPU count under any of
ComputeSDK's spellings (`vcpus`, `cpus`, `resources.vcpus`), and it is mapped
onto the **smallest** named instance type that satisfies both dimensions:

```typescript
// 8 vCPU / 32 GiB (sandbox-lg)
const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create({ vcpus: 8, memory: 16384 })

// ...or name the size outright, which wins over the hints
const xl = await compute.sandbox.create({ size: 'sandbox-xl' })
```

| Size | vCPU | RAM | Billed as |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `sandbox-sm` (default) | 1 | 2 GiB | 2 GiB |
| `sandbox-md` | 4 | 8 GiB | 16 GiB |
| `sandbox-lg` | 8 | 32 GiB | 32 GiB |
| `sandbox-xl` | 16 | 64 GiB | 64 GiB |

Smallest-that-fits rather than largest is deliberate: asking for 8 vCPUs gets
the 8-vCPU shape, never a 16-vCPU one. An ask past the top of the range clamps
to `sandbox-xl` and lets the door refuse it with a message naming your own
ceiling, rather than throwing something less useful locally.

**Sizes above the default are opt-in per workspace.** A new workspace's
`sandbox_vcpus` ceiling is 4 and its `sandbox_ram_gib` ceiling is 8, so
`sandbox-lg` and `sandbox-xl` are refused until an org admin raises both. The
refusal names the limit and how to raise it, and this provider surfaces that
message verbatim.

A named size and `ramGib` are mutually exclusive, because the size already
fixes both dimensions. A memory-only ask stays on `ramGib`, so wanting 6 GiB on
one core gets exactly that instead of being rounded up into a shape you would
be billed more for.

## Container images

Pass any container image by digest and givemeanode will run it:

```typescript
const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create({
  image: 'ghcr.io/acme/task@sha256:abc...',
})
```

Or prepare it once and start many sandboxes from it, which is much faster
per sandbox:

```typescript
const template = await compute.template.create({
  image: 'ghcr.io/acme/task@sha256:abc...',
})
const a = await compute.sandbox.create({ templateId: template.id })
const b = await compute.sandbox.create({ templateId: template.id })
```

Three things to know:

- **The reference must be digest-pinned.** `ghcr.io/acme/task:latest` is
  refused; `ghcr.io/acme/task@sha256:<64 hex>` is accepted. A tag can be
  moved to point at different bytes, and the prepared image is cached under
  the image's identity, so a tag would eventually start a sandbox from
  content that no longer answers to that name. Read a digest with
  `docker buildx imagetools inspect <ref>` or `crane digest <ref>`.
- **Write the registry host in full.** `alpine@sha256:...` is refused
  because it does not say which registry to authenticate to.
- **The first sandbox from a new image is slow**, because the image has to
  be prepared before anything can start; every one after it is fast. Use
  `template.create` when you know the image up front. The provider prepares
  a given image only once per process and shares the result, so starting N
  sandboxes from one image does not prepare it N times.

givemeanode's own curated images are also available by name (`sbx-base`,
the default, has python3, node 24, git, curl and a compiler; `sbx-min` and
`sbx-task` are smaller). Anything containing `@sha256:` is treated as a
container image; anything else is treated as a curated name.

## The signed credential, and why you get it for free

Authenticating a request costs a round trip that presenting a signed
credential does not. givemeanode hands one back on the response to any
request made with your `gmnt_` token:

```
gmn-fast-token:         gmns_<compact JWT>
gmn-fast-token-expires: 2026-08-30T19:48:19Z
```

This package absorbs that offer and presents it automatically. There is
**nothing to configure, nothing new to store, and no extra round trip**:
the offer rides on a response you were already getting, and your `gmnt_`
token stays the only secret you hold. Every failure falls back to the
ordinary credential, so a credential that cannot be used is never worse
than not having one.

Three modes, because the right one depends on your shape:

- **`absorb`** (default) never adds a round trip. Your first request pays
  the ordinary cost, its response carries the credential, and everything
  after it is cheaper - including the command that follows that very
  first create.
- **`prime`** pays one request up front, single-flighted across every
  caller sharing the token, so even the first creates of a burst present
  the credential. It is one `GET /preview/sandboxes` before the first
  create, and that listing crosses to the database: about 115 ms on the
  us-east door.
- **`off`** never presents one.

```typescript
const compute = givemeanode({
  apiKey: process.env.GMN_TOKEN,
  fastToken: 'prime', // pay the warm-up before the first burst
})
```

The default was `absorb` through 1.0.x, `prime` in 1.1.x, and is `absorb`
again from 1.2.0. `prime` was measured on 2026-09-09 against a door that
read its database to validate a `gmnt_` token, so 100 cold creates queued
100 of those reads (about 600 ms of a 767 ms create). Later that day the
door began answering a `gmnt_` from an in-memory replica of its token
table and the read stopped costing anything, while the prime kept costing
its listing: measured from us-east-1 on 2026-09-18 at 100 concurrent
creates over one HTTP/2 session, the median time-to-interactive read 56 to
106 ms with no prime against 166 ms waiting on one.

What it costs, stated plainly: a signed credential is valid for its own
lifetime regardless of what happens to the token behind it, so `gman token
revoke` stops anything **new** immediately, but a credential already in a
client's hands keeps working until it expires. Bans behave the same way.

## One connection for a burst

On Node this provider speaks HTTP/2 to the door: one session per provider,
every request a stream on it, opened when the provider is constructed so
the handshake is paid while you are still setting up. Measured from
us-east-1 against the us-east door, 100 concurrent create-then-command
pairs:

| wire | TTI median | p95 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fetch`, one connection per in-flight request | 211 ms | 315 ms | 338 ms |
| one HTTP/2 session | 40 ms | 44 ms | 45 ms |

The door answered in about 1 ms either way. The difference is the client:
`fetch` opens one TLS connection per in-flight request, a single-threaded
runtime performs those 100 handshakes one after another, and the median
create waited about 170 ms for its turn before a byte reached the door.

`fetch` stays as the fallback wherever `node:http2` is not available
(browsers, edge runtimes) or a session cannot be opened, and it is what an
injected `fetch` selects. Set `transport: 'fetch'` to never open a session,
or `transport: 'http2'` to use one against a plaintext loopback dev server
too (h2c).

Construction sends nothing on the session: your token first leaves the
process with the first operation. Set `warm: 'prime'` to pay the signed
credential's warm-up at construction, so even the first create of a burst
presents it, or `warm: 'off'` to open nothing until the first request. An idle session does not keep a Node
process alive, so a script that makes its requests and returns exits as it
did over `fetch`. A request whose connection never completes fails at its
own `timeout`, and a connection that takes longer than `connectTimeout`
is given up on, with `fetch` answering from then on.
That window is one credential lifetime and no longer.

## Snapshots

A sandbox can be snapshotted, and a snapshot started from. This is the
fastest way to get N copies of a prepared environment:

```typescript
const snapshot = await compute.snapshot.create(sandbox.sandboxId)
const copy = await compute.sandbox.create({ snapshotId: snapshot.id })
```

## Supported

| Feature | Supported |
|---|---|
| `sandbox.create` / `getById` / `list` / `destroy` | yes |
| `runCommand` (cwd, env, background, timeout) | yes |
| `filesystem` (read, write, mkdir, readdir, exists, remove) | yes, over `runCommand` |
| `template.create` / `list` / `destroy` | yes, from a container image |
| `snapshot.create` / `list` / `delete` | yes |
| `getUrl` (a public HTTPS URL for a port) | yes - see below |
| streaming stdout/stderr | not natively; the SDK's bridge applies |

## Two behaviours worth knowing about

**Writes go through base64, not a heredoc.** A heredoc's body is every line
up to its marker, so it can only ever produce a file *ending in a
newline*: writing `hello` and reading it back gave `hello\n`. Base64 has no
such rounding, needs no escaping (the alphabet is shell-inert), and carries
content a heredoc cannot - no trailing newline, a line equal to the marker,
arbitrary bytes. The cost is that the encoded content rides in one argv
entry, so **a single `writeFile` is bounded by the guest's ARG_MAX**,
typically around 1.5 MB of content. Every givemeanode image ships
coreutils, so `base64` is present.

**A command is retried once, and only for one error.** The connection to a
sandbox is re-established on demand, so the first command after a quiet
stretch can find it closed and needs a redial. Nothing else is retried - a
command that ran and failed has an exit code and is returned as a result,
not an exception. In the rare case where the sandbox did receive the
request before the connection dropped, the retry means the command can run
twice, so pass `execRetries: 0` for a workload where that matters.

## The preview URL

`getUrl({ port })` returns a public HTTPS URL that reaches a server
running inside the sandbox - the page a coding agent just wrote, looked at
from outside:

```ts
const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create({ templateId: template.id })
await sandbox.runCommand('sh', ['-c', 'cd app && (npm run dev > /tmp/dev.log 2>&1 &)'])
const url = await sandbox.getUrl({ port: 3000 })
```

Three things decide whether it works:

- **The server listens on the sandbox's loopback.** `127.0.0.1:3000` is
  what dev servers bind by default and is exactly right; the host connects
  in over vsock and the guest dials its own loopback, so no packet arrives
  on the guest's network interface. That also means an exposed port works
  on a sandbox prepared with `egress: 'none'`.
- **The server survives the command that started it.** `runCommand` waits
  for its command's output to end, so `npm run dev &` alone hangs the call
  and then dies with it. Redirect: `(npm run dev > /tmp/dev.log 2>&1 &)`.
- **The URL is the secret.** The hostname carries an unguessable
  capability, so treat it like a password; it expires (24h by default) and
  dies with the sandbox. `unexposePort(sandbox, port)` closes it sooner.

The call is idempotent per port - the same port returns the same URL with
a refreshed expiry - so there is no reason to cache one.

## Limitations

- **An exposed port is HTTP(S) only, and it is a preview URL rather than a
  CDN.** `getUrl({port})` mints a public HTTPS URL that reaches a port
  inside the sandbox; requests ride one proxy hop, which is right for a dev
  server or an API you are testing and not for serving production traffic.
  Streaming, SSE and WebSocket (`protocol: 'wss'`, same URL) pass through.
  A raw TCP port cannot be exposed.
- **Container images must be digest-pinned and registry-qualified**, and
  the first sandbox from a new one is slow. See "Container images".
- **Regional endpoints are not interchangeable.** Set `baseUrl` to the one
  nearest your workload.
