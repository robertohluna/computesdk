# Archil

{% embed url="https://www.computesdk.com/benchmarks/sandboxes/archil/" %}

Archil provider for ComputeSDK

## Installation & Setup

```bash
npm install @computesdk/archil
```

Add your Archil credentials to a `.env` file:

```bash
ARCHIL_API_KEY=your_archil_api_key
ARCHIL_REGION=aws-us-east-1
ARCHIL_DISK_ID=your_archil_disk_id
```

## Usage

Archil is exec-only — `create()` resolves a handle to an existing Archil disk id. Each command runs in an Archil-managed container with that disk attached.

```typescript
import { archil } from '@computesdk/archil';

const compute = archil({
  apiKey: process.env.ARCHIL_API_KEY,
  region: process.env.ARCHIL_REGION,
});

// Attach to an existing Archil disk by id
const diskId = process.env.ARCHIL_DISK_ID;
if (!diskId) throw new Error('ARCHIL_DISK_ID is not set');

const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create({ diskId });

// Run a shell command against the mounted disk
const result = await sandbox.runCommand('echo hello > /mnt/note && cat /mnt/note');
console.log(result.stdout); // "hello"

// destroy() is a no-op — disk lifecycle is managed by Archil
await sandbox.destroy();
```

### Configuration Options

```typescript
interface ArchilConfig {
  /** Archil API key - if not provided, will use ARCHIL_API_KEY env var */
  apiKey?: string;
  /** Archil region (e.g. "aws-us-east-1") - if not provided, will use ARCHIL_REGION env var */
  region?: string;
  /** Override the control-plane base URL (useful for testing) */
  baseUrl?: string;
}
```

### Supported Operations

| Method       | Supported | Notes                                                              |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `create`     | ✅         | Resolves an existing disk from top-level `diskId`.                 |
| `getById`    | ✅         | Requires the disk id.                                              |
| `list`       | ✅         | Lists all disks visible to the API key.                            |
| `destroy`    | no-op     | Disk lifecycle is managed by Archil.                               |
| `runCommand` | ✅         | Calls Archil's HTTP `exec` endpoint and waits for completion.      |
| `getInfo`    | ✅         |                                                                    |
| `getUrl`     | ❌         | Each exec runs in a fresh ephemeral container — no port to expose. |
| `filesystem` | ✅         | Accepts normal paths and maps them into `/mnt/archil`; shared-mode checkout/checkin is automatic. |

### Limitations

* Each `exec` call provisions a fresh container — no persistent state between calls beyond what is written to the disk.
* Responses are truncated to \~5 MB by the Archil control plane.
* `getUrl` is not supported — each exec runs in a fresh ephemeral container, so there is no long-lived process to expose a port on.
* Filesystem operations accept normal absolute paths and map them into `/mnt/archil` internally.
* Raw `runCommand` strings are not rewritten. Commands that access the disk directly must use `/mnt/archil` themselves.
